Title:

Policy-Simulator DAO

Version:

1.0.0

Description:

Policy-Simulator DAO is a governance smart contract built in Clarity that allows decentralized communities to create, vote on, simulate, and execute policy proposals before real-world implementation. It provides a sandbox for testing governance models by simulating voting outcomes and decision-making processes.

🧩 Core Features

Proposal Management:
Authorized users can create policy proposals with a title, description, and custom voting period.

Voting System:
Members vote for or against proposals based on their assigned voting power. Each member can vote only once per proposal.

Membership Control:
The contract owner can add members and assign them custom voting power to reflect different levels of influence.

Simulation Mode:
Once voting ends, the contract owner can simulate potential outcomes by attaching a simulation description to the proposal.

Execution Logic:
Proposals with more votes for than against can be executed (marked as successfully passed).

Transparency and Queries:
Anyone can view proposals, votes, member voting power, and proposal statuses via read-only functions.

🛠️ Smart Contract Design Overview
Data Variables

proposal-counter: Tracks the total number of proposals created.

Data Maps

proposals: Stores metadata and results of each proposal.

votes: Keeps track of individual votes by proposal and voter.

member-voting-power: Defines each member’s voting weight.

Constants

CONTRACT-OWNER: The account that deployed the contract.

Error codes for invalid actions (e.g., unauthorized access, duplicate votes, voting ended).

MAX-VOTING-PERIOD and MIN-VOTING-PERIOD define safe voting durations.

⚙️ Key Functions
Public Functions
Function	Description
add-member (member principal) (voting-power uint)	Adds a member with specified voting power. Owner-only.
create-proposal (title string) (description string) (voting-period uint)	Creates a new proposal with bounded voting period.
vote (proposal-id uint) (vote-for bool)	Allows members to vote on active proposals.
simulate-outcome (proposal-id uint) (simulation-description string)	Owner can add a simulation result after voting ends.
execute-proposal (proposal-id uint)	Executes proposals that have passed voting and not yet executed.
Read-Only Functions
Function	Description
get-proposal (proposal-id uint)	Returns details of a proposal.
get-vote (proposal-id uint) (voter principal)	Returns an individual’s vote record.
get-member-power (member principal)	Retrieves a member’s voting power.
get-proposal-count	Returns the total number of proposals created.
get-proposal-status (proposal-id uint)	Returns proposal state (active, votes count, leading side, etc.).
🧠 Voting Lifecycle Example

Add Members — Contract owner adds members with voting power.

Create Proposal — Any user submits a policy proposal.

Vote — Members vote for or against within the allowed block period.

Simulate Outcome — After voting ends, the owner runs simulations to predict impact.

Execute Proposal — If “for” votes > “against,” proposal can be executed.

✅ Safety and Validation

Enforces authorization for member management and simulation.

Prevents double voting per proposal.

Rejects votes after voting period ends.

Guards against invalid voting durations.

Ensures proposals cannot be executed more than once.
